# Approach

I came up with this concept whilke I was planning my honeymoon with my fiance. As we wrote down what we wanted to do on our trip, I realized I needed a better way to store this info and have a constant updated budget everytime we thought of a new activity. I began by creating a simple drawn out wireframe of what I wanted the app to look like.This approach helped with the styling and componennt selection I would need with react native. I then began running through react-native tutorials until I was able to create something close to my vision.

# Issues
This project was challenging but a great learning experience. Just going through react-native tutorials was a challenge on its own. The project continues to transform into my overall vision however, I still have a ways to go. I will add a currency tab and another page for saved trips with activities saved within them.

### Take aways: 
* Use Redux
*Read ujp more on native Base for styling
